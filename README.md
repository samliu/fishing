## Introduction

A couple of months ago my partner and I went on a fishing trip on the bay: we
caught a 17" Striped Bass (1" under the 18" limit), as well as an 8lbs Halibut
that we later seasoned and had for dinner. We didn't do much besides ride the
boat, hook bait, plop them in the water when told to, and reel them up. It was
the perfect way to get hooked on fishing though!

Seized with the fishing bug, I went out and bought a bunch of fishing equipment
from [Gus's Discount Tackle](http://www.gusdiscounttackle.com), which is one of
the few fishing shops in San Francisco. There is another shop to the south, but
I was in Sunset so I tried out a few things and decided on two $30 rods good for
saltwater pier and freshwater fishing. The store owner Steph recommended that I
try powerbait for freshwater trout and catfish, and gave me the correct sized
(small) hooks. She gave me some larger hooks and weights for saltwater pier
fishing, saying I should use some chicken liver or live baitfish when trying
that. Seems like people here use anchovies most frequently.

The next weekend I went to [Pacifica
Pier](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Pacifica+Municipal+Pier/@37.6333788,-122.498441,17z).
Apparently you don't need a [California State Fishing
License](https://www.wildlife.ca.gov/Licensing/Fishing) to fish from municipal
piers. It was really crowded however and it seemed like a lot of waiting in
windy / cold conditions to fish on a pier. We decided against fishing there, and
made other plans to find a decent place to test out our rods.

Shannon scouted out a reservoir that might be a good place to start: [Lafayette
Reservoir](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Lafayette+Reservoir+Recreation+Area/@37.8847926,-122.145527,15z)
between Oakland and Walnut Creek. We rented a rowboat for the day (~$20) and
spent our time trying not to drift too close to the reeds, clanging around and
throwing baited hooks down at different depths for hours.

We really didn't know what we were doing though. So I started to do some
research, but there's a lot to learn and a lot of fishing terms! I'll keep all
the information I learn about fishing here.
