# Fishing Line

## Types

There are (2) main kinds of line: braid and monofilament. Both come in colors but only monofilament has clear. Both are good and catch fish.

### Braided Line (Braid Line)

Braid is stronger in general per thickness vs monofilament, and is kind of like sewing thread in consistency. It's harder
to tie some knots on braid just because it's like dealing with thread.

### Monofilament (Mono Line)

Mono is more common. You have the option to have clear line, which is nice for being less visible to fish. It has a
bit of stretch to it which can help in some kinds of fishing.

## Line Weight

Line weight is measured in lbs and that just refers to how much weight (at minimum) can be held by the static line.
In practice a line's strength is 50% stronger than the rated weight (also called _test_, e.g _25lbs test_).

You can also haul in fish larger than the weight of your line! But it has to do with technique. If the fish is thrashing
it can break strong line.

You generally care about whether the fish can see the line but also whether you can see the line as it goes into the water,
especially for saltwater fishing.

You should look at your reel to find out how much of what kind of line fits on the reel.

## Line Memory

Memory refers to when you bend a line, whether it bounces back to a neutral shape or if it retains the shape it was given. 
Good fishing line needs to have low memory. With monofilament line, one trick some anglers use is to douse in a little warm
water to reset the memory a bit. If your line has too much memory and gets twisted, it does weird things (casts poorly,
jumps off the reel, etc).
