# Lake Fishing Strategy

* __Fish the temperature__: If you are fishing in colder weather with lures, they have to move but maybe move more like
  the other fish who are all moving more sluggishly. They wiggle gently instead of wobbling a lot side to side. As a
  result in the winter for lake fishing, don't use swimbaits! Try lipless crankbaits instead. They have less wobble.

* __Topwater fish morning and evening__: Fish are more likely to strike at the top of the water in early morning or when
  it's getting closer to dark. Fish topwater lures in the early morning or when the sun is falling.
