### Rainbow Trout

Rainbow trout are the favorite of many anglers for a few reasons:

* They are "bite first think later" fish, so they're easy to catch.
* Many parks stock them in lakes, so there are great times to get them.
* They taste really good!

Some tips for catching rainbow trout:

* Don't use line heavier than 2lbs. Though they will bite at anything that looks
  yummy, if they notice the line they won't go for it. Also the largest rainbow
  trout you'll catch is probably only around 5lbs so you don't need heavy line.
  Most rainbows will be between 1/2lbs to 3lbs.
* They love earthworms (nightcrawlers) and are attracted to the movement. If your
  worm isn't moving, switch it out.
* They love the smell of powerbait if they're farmed trout; if they're wild trout
  they like things like Salmon roe. A single salmon egg on a small hook can be effective.
* Fly fishing: they like eating surface food (bugs) so fly fishing is super effective on them.

Fish mostly eat what they're used to, so don't try to use powerbait on a wild trout. It
probably won't go for it.

## Bass

### Black Basses

[Black Basses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micropterus) are a family of freshwater bass including: largemouth bass, spotted bass, and smallmouth bass. These bass are well-known for being hard-fighting fish. That means they flop around A LOT when they're pulled out of the water, and it's really fun.

The California Dept of Fish and Wildlife recommends using Rip Baits such as Smithwick or TD Minnow, Plastic Worms (brown and green), Zara Spooks, Rico, Spoons of various sizes, Spinnerbaits, Crank Baits, Frogs, and Senkos to catch Bass.

#### Largemouth Bass

* [Largemouth Bass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Largemouth_bass) max out around 22lbs (that's extraordinarily large) but you should be happy to get anything 5lbs or more.
* Water Depth: TODO
* Season: TODO
* Preferred Lures: plastic worms (and other plastic baits), jigs, crankbaits and spinnerbaits.
* Preferred Baits: nightcrawlers, minnows, frogs, crawfish, golden shiners (a kind of baitfish).

#### Smallmouth Bass

* [Smallmouth Bass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smallmouth_bass) max out around 12lbs.
* Water Depth: TODO
* Season: TODO
* Preferred Lures: crankbaits, hair jigs, plastic jerkbaits, artificial worms, spinnerbaits, and all types of soft plastic lures, including curly tail grubs or tubes with lead head jigs.
* Preferred Baits: nightcrawlers, all kinds of other live things. They eat many things.
* Other details: 

### Striped Bass

* [Striped Bass](https://www.wildlife.ca.gov/Fishing/Inland/Striped-Bass) can get up to 110lbs but in California the largest one ever was ~70lbs.
* Water Depth: TODO
* Season: All year, but they feed a lot less in cold weather. Wait for warm seasons for it to get good. They migrate between fresh and salt water! During the summer and fall, striped bass fishing is at its peak in San Francisco Bay. Trollers and live bait drifters make good catches with regularity in Raccoon Strait, at the south tower of the Golden Gate Bridge, at submerged rocky reefs in central San Francisco Bay, and off Alcatraz and Treasure Islands.
* Preferred Lures: in the ocean use a _bucktail jig_.
* Preferred Baits: in the ocean use a _surf leader_ rig with octopus hooks. Apparently sand crabs are also great for surf fishing.
* Other details: To avoid catching too many undersized stripers, it is advisable to use hooks at least half an inch between the point and the shank. Fewer small fish will swallow the large hooks, so serious injuries will be reduced.

On feeding habits, from the CA Dept of Fish and Wildlife website:

> Striped bass are voracious feeders. They generally feed on the most available and abundant invertebrates and forage fish 
> of the appropriate size.
>
> Initially, small bass feed on tiny crustacean plankton, but, after a few weeks, the favorite food becomes the
> mysid shrimp and amphipods. Mysid shrimp are most numerous where salt levels are 1â€“20 percent of sea water.
> Young striped bass are most numerous in the same area. Larger stripers tend to prefer larger food items.
> In San Francisco Bay, anchovies, shiner perch, and herring are important in the diet. Anchovies, sculpins (bullheads), 
> and shrimp make up the bulk of the diet in San Pablo Bay. In the Delta and upriver areas, larger bass feed mainly on 
> threadfin shad, young striped bass, and other small fish.
